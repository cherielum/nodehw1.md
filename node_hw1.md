# Node.js Homework 1

1. Follow the instructions for installing the "learn you node" NPM module on your local machine. Complete up to the ```HTTP``` section.

1. What are some similarities between how your run code in python and node? What are some differences?
First of all both languages bring people to think of backend development because the things you type in python and node are not visible to the end users. However, python is a programming language whereas Node.js is an environment allowing js code to run on the server side and not in a browser. 

With regards to errors, Node.js has Undefined and Null whereas Python has just None. Python defines a new variable as soon as you assign to it, and not before. If you use a variable that doesn't exist, you get NameError and when you try to access an attribute on an object or a value in a dictionary that does not exist, you get AttributeError or KeyError. In Node.js, you can define a local variable without giving it a value- value undefined. The similarities for this part would be that Python's None is like Node.js's null (values that exist and are explicitly set to null or empty- intentionally absent value).   

Another difference is that Node.js has built in Array-types with square brackets. Python has List and Tuples. However Node.js has no mutable/immutable distinctions, and therefore cannot compare to Python's Tuples.  

1. What does asynchronous mean? Why is it important to understanding how to write code in JavaScript?
Asynchronous is two or more objects not existing or happening at the same time. Javascript is important to understand and write it is easier to debug by checking console.log for instance, or also help examine HTML/CSS code of webpages to take an in-depth look at an entire application. AJAX which stands for asynchronous javascript and XML, is a set of interrelated web development technologies which enable web browsers to intereact asynchronously with the web server. Using AJAX, webpages get updated in the background without reloading and refreshing the webpage. This means the user experience is not interrupted but also dynamic because the content of the webpage is continuously updating to the newest version. Before, the web was a place for viewing static pages. AJAX has now transformed the web into a place where users can interact with websites and other users as well. Without javascript there would be no AJAX.
